Question 3 : 
Which line will show error and why?
#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
char *a = "India";
char b[] = "India";
a = a+1;//line 5
b = b+1;//line 6
}

Answer: 

Line 5 will not show an error, but line 6 will.

In line 5, a is a pointer to a string literal, which is stored in read-only memory. Therefore, we can modify the pointer to point to a different location in memory, but we cannot modify the string literal itself. So, a = a + 1; will not cause an error, as it simply increments the pointer to point to the next character in the string.

However, in line 6, b is an array of characters, which is stored in read-write memory. Therefore, we can modify the contents of the array. But, we cannot modify the array variable b itself to point to a different location in memory. So, b = b + 1; will cause a compile-time error, as it tries to assign a new value to the array variable b.

The correct way to increment the pointer a to point to the next character in the string would be to use the pointer dereference operator * like this:

a = a + 1; // incorrect
*a = *a + 1; // correct
